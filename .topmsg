Subject: [PATCH] prune stale remote branch when update

Prune stale remote branch when running "tg remote --populate origin"
(using "git fetch --prune refspecs ...").

The order of refspecs for "git fetch --prune" is important, because
both heads and top-bases are mapped under the same namespace
"refs/remotes/$name/". If the refspecs are in wrong order, stale refs
reverse lookup would fail, i.e. "refs/remotes/origin/top-bases/t/XX"
would reverse lookup as "refs/heads/top-bases/t/XX", not
"refs/top-bases/t/XX", and "refs/remotes/$name/top-bases/*" would be
deleted by accident.
