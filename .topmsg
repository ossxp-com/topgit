Subject: [PATCH] t/tg_graph_ascii_output

Finally, I have managed to work on an old idea: to display the dependency graph
line-by-line on the console.  The insiration comes from the git log --graph
command, the implementation too.  I have ported the graph.c file from the
GIT project into the GVPR graph processing language from the graphviz package.
Thats why I have Cc'ed Adam, the original author of the GIT graph API and I
would like to thank him for it.  But I must also apologize to him that I
haven't gave him credit in this first patch (only here in the message).  Which
should be done, before accepting into the topgit.git.

Actually, this is still a proof-of-concept, because I'm uncertain wheather we
need a new command for this or not.

As you can see from the tg graph options, there is many you can tweak.  I think
the dfs options gives compacter graphs for depending topics.  Dfs gives
compacter graphs for the reversed dependencies (i.e. master as first line) for
me too.  So dfs should probably the default.

Please try.

Thanks,
Bert
